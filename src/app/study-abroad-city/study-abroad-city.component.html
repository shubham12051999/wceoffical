                    <b>Beyond Education:</b>
                            <p>Besides the fact that America is like a beautiful molten chocolate cake, luring and teasing us offering the very best, both in terms of educational facilities as well as lifestyle, there are certain things about America that makes it undeniably one of the most sought after educational hubs in the world. To begin with, America has more than 10 campuses per country than any other country in the world. At the undergraduate level, the US provides excellent programmes both in the traditional as well as professional subjects. Apart from variety, some of the advantages of studying in the US are exposure to cutting edge technology, opportunity for research, training & teaching, flexibility of courses, support service for international students, rich campus life and global education facilities.</p>
                            
                            <b>Array of opportunities:</b>
                            <p>Students aspiring to study in the US can choose from a wide range of subjects from over 3600 colleges, universities and institutes covering about 900 fields of study. And probably this is why America is the number one destination for international students. And why not, because students have the liberty to choose from public or private university, a liberal arts college or a technical school, a women's or men's only college to a religiously-affiliated institution. The American structure of study is not just lectures, study sessions and tests. It comprises of community activities as well through varied social, cultural, and sports activities.</p>
                            
                            <b>Education System in USA</b>
                            <p>The more you know about the American educational system, the more you will benefit from it.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The United States does not have a single unified education system. Federal and state laws regulate the operation of educational institutions to an extent, but few laws govern the actual subject areas covered or educational goals at any given academic level.</li>
                                    <li>Public education for children in America is extremely fragmented, and is usually under the control of local communities. Private education, including schools affiliated with religious organizations, has an even lower level of government oversight.</li>
                                    <li>The American university system is not really a system at all, it is so diverse, encompassing private and public institutions, some operating for profit. Private corporations, rather than the government, administer a system of aptitude examinations for college entry, even to public universities. Specialized trade and technical schools fill an important need. For people who are working but still would like to further their education, it is possible to obtain a masters degree through one of many MBA online programs that are available. For people whose main goal is the love of learning rather than the attainment of educational degrees, adult education centers exist in many communities.</li>
                                </ul>
                            

                            <b>Colleges and Universities</b>
                            <p>The terms college and university are often used interchangeably. A university is a larger institution often having more than one college for example law, medical and dental schools or business or other specialized schools. The term campus refers to the land the college sits on and the buildings on it. Colleges range from huge state-supported university systems to small liberal arts and religious schools.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Two year colleges, often called community colleges, usually award the Associate of Arts degree (A.A.). They accept most applicants, are often public supported, and have lower tuition than four-year schools.</li>
                                    <li>Four year colleges, called undergraduate schools, form the mainstream of American higher education. Admission requirements, courses offered, residence facilities and other features will vary widely. These colleges give bachelors degrees, usually a bachelor of arts (B.A.) or a bachelor of science (B.S.).</li>
                                    <li>Private colleges can be extremely expensive. Students with financial difficulties have access to a well-developed system of financial aid, however, which can dramatically reduce costs through a combination of grants, loans, and work-study programs.</li>
                                </ul>
                            

                            <b>Types of Colleges:</b>
                            <p>The most prestigious colleges in the eastern part of the United States--like Harvard, Princeton and Yale--are known as the Ivy League because of the characteristic ivy plants that frequently grow on the sides of their beautiful old buildings. Other colleges, especially some of the large state schools, are known as football or basketball schools due to their emphasis on athletics. Most colleges are co-educational (co-ed), meaning that they accept both men and women, though many single-sex colleges still exist.</p>
                            <p>Colleges and universities with religious affiliations are widely found in America. Some, though not all, give or require religious instruction along with academic subjects. Most major religious groups in America have their own systems of sponsored colleges.</p>

                            <b>Eligibility to apply to universities in USA</b>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A lot of paperwork!</li>
                                    <li>The college application process in the United States is elaborate. Though colleges do cooperate on certain paperwork matters, like the Scholastic Aptitude Test and some financial aid applications, each college will have different application forms and fees, different deadlines, and different requirements for admission. Choosing the right college is the first step. Many guides to American colleges are published, and extensive information on colleges is available on the Internet.</li>
                                    <li>Good academics</li>
                                    <li>TOEFL/ IELTS /GMAT/GRE/SAT (As per the university requirement)</li>
                                    <li>Finance to support education</li>
                                    <li>Passport</li>
                                </ul>
                                Once you are accepted to a college, the work will begin all over again. You will have a great deal of paperwork to do.
                            

                            <b>Job prospects in USA</b>

                    <p>Students are permitted to work <b><u>20 hours per week</u></b> on-campus during the first years of study. In the second year students are allowed to take part-time jobs or co-op/internships off campus to fulfil academic or financial requirements. The on campus jobs do not pay much and certainly not enough to finance a university education. This kind of jobs can only be a supplement to other funds.</p>
                        <p>Along with the acceptability and recognition of education, USA also offers the best in terms of future job prospects and immigration possibilities after studies. All students are entitled to stay back and work for one year period in USA under OPT (Optional Professional Training). Majority of the students are successful in finding a suitable placement and secure H1B (Job Visa) during the period.</p>
                        <p>Once you enrolled in the campus, there will be "The International Student Orientation Program," coordinated by the Admissions Office or the Office of International Programs. This program will introduce you to social life on a U.S. campus. Information on many topics like immigration, academic advisors, computer and library resources, telephone services, public safety, medical services, and banking and transportation options will be provided through this program.</p>
                        <p>There are many transportation options for getting around in your new country. A bicycle or bike is affordable travel options for short distances. If you are living in a city, the bus system will likely be pretty extensive, as with most of the public transportation systems in large urban areas. Trains are good for travelling the USA. They are slightly more expensive than travelling by bus, but it is much quicker. Taxis can be extremely expensive for students.</p>
